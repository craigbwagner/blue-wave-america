That's why I started Blue Wave America—I know there are still Democrats we can turn out in deep red counties. We did it in 2022 and 2024, and we are doing it full-steam for 2025 and 2026.”",

				We are a team of rural Democrats across the country working to

				Founded by Mike Ward, a former Congressman from Kentucky,
				Associate Director of the Peace Corps, and veteran Democratic
				strategist, Blue Wave America has been focused since day one on
				expanding this long-forgotten Democratic constituency.
